###Box vs Box Terror

Sad story ... This was written for https://itch.io/jam/linux-jam-2017, but because of my crappy internet, I was thwarted by a failed upload. I could have represented AND gotten a bonus point, but that's all bits under the bridge now. It was written using these rules:

+ Your game's art assets and programming should be made within said time frame.
+ Your game must be submitted to this page.
+ Your game must have a Linux build.
+ Your game can use Godot, Unity, Love2d, any others, or your own custom built engine.
+ You get exactly one bonus point if your game is open source.
   + Bonus points are meaningless.

unzip and load LinuxJam2017.atomic into the Atomic Game Engine editor and play.

Dispite it's name, it will run on all platforms. It was created completely on the Linux platform using AGE, gimp, audacity (and a Galaxy S4 to capture textures and audio). The only things used "stock" were the box, torus and dome models, which are from Urho3D.

####The Story :
A big crate of service boxes has broken open, and you have to attach "control donuts" to the scattering and wonky service boxes as quickly as possible. Those who finish fastest wins!

Hint: if you run out of ammo (well, donuts), there are some pickups around to replenish the supply.

####Controls :
+ WSAD or Arrow keys to move.
+ Mouse button 3 moves forward.
+ Left Shift for Speed.
+ "Z" or Mouse button 1 click to fire the donuts
+ "F" to toggle between 3rd person, 1st person
+ Esc to exit
