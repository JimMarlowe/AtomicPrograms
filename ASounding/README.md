### ASounding noise masking app
by JimMarlowe

Just unzip and load ASounding.atomic and run in the AtomicEditor, and you can deploy to your favorite platform, works on desktop and mobile.

### This program is ASounding
 Not to be confused with astounding :) and was created to generate masking sounds to overwhelm bad or missing environmental noises. Like, if you want to sleep and you're in a strange place, isn't that always the way?
 
### How you work this thing?
 It's built like a mixing board. You get 8 prime masking sounds (or noises), and you adjust the faders to your liking. The Master fader adjusts the overall sound level. Go ahead, mix it like there is no tomorrow.
On mobile, the faders can be tricky to operate. fyi.

If you quit the app with the exit button (except on IOS), your fader settings will be saved and restored.
